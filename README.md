# CloudBoard

This project aims at improving your experience with cloud computing services. In this current market there exists various Cloud Service companies and many (mostly freelancers) would have resources in more than one service provider. <br>

## Description

This project will combine the statistics from various platforms like Azure, AWS and GCP to provide all the needed information in one place. Making it easy to keep track of the resources, the budgets associated with them as well as recommendations to optimize these resources. <br>
For this we will need a UI and I will be using [React](https://react.dev) as my framework for this, as I am most experienced in this techonology while also it having the most support from the community and their third party packages.<br>
With all the community package support out there, I had a lot of options to choose to assist me with the UI components but I decided to go with Chakra for this one, as it was something new to me and I have never worked with it but it looked pretty asthetic. <br>

There were some challenges that I ran into before I even started the project execution, and that was during the planning. If I am integrating data from multiple sources than I ofcourse need to do it using the API's provided by these sources/services. But reading through such a profound API documentation just to implement a data analysis UI was definetly not easy for a beginner like me. I was lost in all kinds of api's that they were providing (which were totally not realted to what I wanted but I was just so lost), but then finally landed on the one api endpoint that would help with this. I initially only worked with a single service provider (AWS), and worked on implementing the solution before I dove deeper with all of the services.
